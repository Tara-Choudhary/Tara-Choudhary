# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Tara Choudhary!  

I started my journey in **web development**, exploring **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** early on.  
Along the way, I ventured into **UI/UX and graphic design**, which gave me a strong eye for aesthetics and user experience.  
However, I realized that **coding is where my true passion lies**, and now Iâ€™m fully focused on **front-end development**â€”  
learning, building, and improving my fundamentals every day.  

## ðŸ’¡ What Iâ€™m Learning & Working On:  
- **Core Front-End Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Modern Frameworks**: ReactJS (currently learning & practicing)  
- **Building Responsive & Accessible Interfaces**  

## ðŸš€ Why Iâ€™m Here?  
I'm committed to **strengthening my front-end skills, writing clean and efficient code,  
and contributing to real-world projects**. Excited to connect with fellow developers,  
collaborate, and grow in this journey!

# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Tara Choudhary!  

I started my journey in **web development**, exploring **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** early on.  
Along the way, I ventured into **UI/UX and graphic design**, which gave me a strong eye for aesthetics and user experience.  
However, I realized that **coding is where my true passion lies**, and now Iâ€™m fully focused on **front-end development**â€”  
learning, building, and improving my fundamentals every day.  

## ðŸ’¡ What Iâ€™m Learning & Working On:  
- **ðŸŽ¨ Graphic & UI/UX Design â€“ Refining my visual storytelling & user experience skills**  
- **ðŸ’» Python & Data Science â€“ Rebuilding my coding foundation & exploring data-driven insights** 


## ðŸš€ Why Iâ€™m Here?  
I'm committed to refining my design skills, expanding my coding knowledge, and building a career in tech. Excited to connect, collaborate, and grow in this journey!

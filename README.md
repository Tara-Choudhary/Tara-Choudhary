# 👋 Hi, I'm Tara Choudhary

I'm currently focused on building a strong foundation in technology through hands-on learning and real-world project work.

My learning path is centered around **Python**, where I’m working on small projects to improve how I think and solve problems with code. I'm also gradually exploring tools that support system-level thinking and long-term growth in software development.

I enjoy approaching each concept with curiosity, clarity, and a mindset of continuous learning.
